# Zomes.

To make your own Zome, check the demo [here](https://florianwns.github.io/zomes/).

## Project history 

Initially this project was just a fork of the project created by [Tim Hutton](https://timhutton.github.io/zomes/). 
And then after having rewritten almost all the source code, 
I decided to make it a separate project, with the same license.
