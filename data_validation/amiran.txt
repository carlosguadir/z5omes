Hello! I saw your post, and also commented in the zome network group. This is another opportunity for me to say thank you! I am an amateur, not from the field. I recently learned how to build a geodesic dome. I was also exposed to a zome type structure, and I fell in love with this type of structure and made it my goal to learn how to build it, and hope to soon build such a structure. But I'm still trying to figure out how it works. I did not find much information in English on the Internet. I was also exposed to your calculator, used it and was happy to see today that you updated it. But there are still things that are not clear to me and I would be happy if you could help me or direct me to another source of knowledge. What I don't understand are the angles. I found a plan online, entered the same data into your calculator and got exactly the same lengths, except for the angles.
(But maybe I didn't understand well).
For example, the first rhombus, all the lengths are equal in the plan and in your calculator,
but the angles are different:

35.1, 35.2, 36, 38.2, for one type of angles,
and 1.1, 14.8, 12.3, 25.8, for the second type of angles.

Your calculator shows these angles: 35.1, 144.9, 40.22, 151.39.


Can you explain to me what I'm missing?
How come all the lengths are equal but the angles still don't match?
I'm sure it's something pretty small and silly but since I'm new to this,
it's not clear to me. Hope I didn't bother you. Thanks!
